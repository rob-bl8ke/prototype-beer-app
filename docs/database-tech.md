# What is JPA and JDBC?

**JPA (Java Persistence API)** and **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)** are both technologies in Java for interacting with databases, but they serve different purposes and operate at different levels of abstraction.

---

### **JPA (Java Persistence API)**

- **What it is:**  
  JPA is a specification that provides a higher-level, object-oriented abstraction for working with relational databases. It is part of the Java EE (now Jakarta EE) specification but is widely used in standard Java applications.

- **Purpose:**  
  JPA is designed to bridge the gap between object-oriented programming and relational databases. It maps Java objects to database tables using **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**.

- **Features:**
  - Entity classes represent tables in the database.
  - It supports advanced querying via JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language).
  - Handles relationships between entities (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-one).
  - Handles transactions, caching, and lazy loading of data.

- **Popular Implementations:**
  - **Hibernate** (most popular and widely used).
  - EclipseLink.
  - OpenJPA.

- **Advantages:**
  - Simplifies database access by abstracting raw SQL.
  - Reduces boilerplate code for CRUD operations.
  - Allows focus on business logic rather than database interaction details.

### **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**

- **What it is:**  
  JDBC is a lower-level API that allows Java applications to interact directly with relational databases using SQL.

- **Purpose:**  
  It provides a standard way to establish a connection to a database, execute SQL queries, and retrieve or manipulate results.

- **Features:**
  - Connects to a database using a JDBC driver.
  - Allows you to run SQL statements like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
  - Returns query results in the form of `ResultSet`.

- **Advantages:**
  - Fine-grained control over database operations.
  - Universally supported by all relational database systems.

- **Drawbacks:**
  - Requires writing raw SQL.
  - Involves more boilerplate code for common operations.

### **Comparison:**

| Feature               | JPA                                      | JDBC                                    |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Abstraction Level** | High-level ORM                          | Low-level SQL interaction               |
| **Ease of Use**       | Simplifies database interaction         | Requires explicit SQL and handling      |
| **Object Mapping**    | Maps Java objects to database tables    | Works with raw SQL and database schemas |
| **Query Language**    | JPQL or native SQL                      | SQL                                     |
| **Transactions**      | Managed by JPA provider or manually     | Must be handled manually                |
| **Code Complexity**   | Less boilerplate                       | More boilerplate                        |

### **Which to Use?**
- Use **JPA** if you prefer abstraction, productivity, and are dealing with complex object mappings.
- Use **JDBC** if you need fine-grained control, or for scenarios where JPA's overhead is unnecessary, such as simple queries or lightweight applications.
